# Hello! I'm Lance. 👋

### Nice to meet ya! 

I'm a Web Developer who works with React on the frontend and Node.js + Express on the backend.

I love to tinker, troubleshoot, and provide tech support to others when they need help. I have been a long time GNU/Linux Desktop user, and have experience with software installation and quickly getting computers up and running, as a "distro-hopper" always anxious to try new things.

Fun fact: I assembled my first personal computer before I turned 14; I still use it, today. :-)

### Find me on...
