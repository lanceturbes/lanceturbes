# Hello! I'm Lance. üëã

### Nice to meet ya! 

I'm a Web Developer who works with React on the frontend, and Node via the Express framework on the backend. I'm currently a student at the Bloom Institute of Technology working to build and improve my technical and interpersonal developer skills. 

I love to tinker, troubleshoot, and provide tech support to others when they need help. I have been a long time GNU/Linux Desktop user, and have experience with software installation and quickly getting computers up and running, as a "distro-hopper" always anxious to try new things.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a Full Stack To-Do Planner app
- üß™ I love writing tests for JavaScript web apps using Jest + React Testing Library / SuperTest
- üêß Ask me about Linux Desktop, and I'll help you as best I can! I've used Debian, Elementary, Fedora, Mint, openSUSE, Pop!_OS, Raspbian, Ubuntu, and Zorin, and currently use Arch Linux.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I assembled my first personal computer before I turned 14; I still use it, today. :-)
- üå† I wish that the market for computer chips would stabilize so things are affordable for normal people, again!
