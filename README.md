# Hello! I'm Lance. 👋

### Nice to meetcha! 

I'm a Web Developer who works with React.js on the frontend, and Node.js/Express.js on the backend. I love to tinker, troubleshoot, and provide tech support to others when they need help. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my understanding of Computer Science fundamentals
- 🌱 Right now, I'm learning Python as a JavaScript person
- 🐧 Ask me about Linux Desktop, and I'll help you as best I can! I've used Debian, Elementary, Fedora, Mint, openSUSE, Pop!_OS, Raspbian, Ubuntu, and Zorin, and currently use Arch Linux.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I assembled my first personal computer before I turned 14; I still use it, today. :-)
