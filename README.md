### Hello! I'm Lance. 👋

Nice to meetcha! 

I'm a Web Developer who works with React on the frontend, and Nodejs/Expressjs on the backend. I love to tinker, troubleshoot, and document programs to help others.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my understanding of Computer Science fundamentals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as a JavaScript person
- 💬 Ask me about Linux Desktop, and I'll help you as best I can!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I assembled my first personal computer before I turned 14; I still use it, today. :-)
