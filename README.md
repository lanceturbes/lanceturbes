# Hello! I'm Lance. 👋

### Nice to meet ya! 

I'm a Web Developer who works with React on the frontend, and Node via the Express framework on the backend. 

I love to tinker, troubleshoot, and provide tech support to others when they need help. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Full Stack To-Do Planner app
- 🧪 I love writing tests for JavaScript web apps using Jest + React Testing Library / SuperTest
- 🐧 Ask me about Linux Desktop, and I'll help you as best I can! I've used Debian, Elementary, Fedora, Mint, openSUSE, Pop!_OS, Raspbian, Ubuntu, and Zorin, and currently use Arch Linux.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I assembled my first personal computer before I turned 14; I still use it, today. :-)
